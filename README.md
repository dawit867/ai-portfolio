## Components

### LLM Pipelines

Our LLM pipelines demonstrate how to work with large language models. These pipelines utilize Hugging Face's Transformers library to facilitate model training and inference. You will find various examples, including:

- Text generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Language translation

Each example comes with clear documentation to guide you through the process.

### Model Training Notebooks

The model training notebooks provide a hands-on approach to understanding model training. You will find notebooks covering topics such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Model selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation

These notebooks are designed to be interactive, allowing you to modify parameters and see the results in real time.

### Real-World Deployments

Deploying machine learning models can be challenging. Our real-world deployment examples show you how to effectively deploy models in various environments. You will learn about:

- Containerization with Docker
- API development using Flask
- Testing and validation techniques

These resources will help you build robust AI solutions that can be deployed in production.
